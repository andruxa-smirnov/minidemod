minidemod
=========

The purpose of `minidemod-wfm` is to have a few lines long C program
that can actually demodulate WFM from an I/Q input.

The whole DSP chain is built by OS pipes, just like this:

	rtl_sdr -s 250000 -f 89500000 -g 20 - | tcc -lm -run minidemod-wfm.c \
		| sox -t raw -r 250000 -e unsigned -b 8 -c 1 - -t raw - rate 48000 \
		| mplayer -quiet -rawaudio samplesize=1:channels=1:rate=48000 -demuxer rawaudio -

Read like this:

	rtl_sdr (acquires samples) | minidemod-wfm (demodulates) \
		| sox (low pass filter + decimation) | mplayer (audio output) `

To run it, you will need a Linux box with `rtl_sdr tcc sox mplayer` installed.
